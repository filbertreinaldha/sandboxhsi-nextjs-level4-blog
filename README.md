# Introduction
This is Level 4 of Sandbox HSI - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) program. The program was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

In this level, we are demonstrating our knowledge of using Next.js to build a simple website and using Typescript in the development process. This site pretty much looks the same as the Level 3 quiz, but with Typescript and some different tech stack used.

1. Home page, showing lists of articles.
2. Article details page, showing details of an article and some related articles.
